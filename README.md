# Matt Baier — Personal Site & Resume

This repository contains my personal website and interactive résumé.  
It highlights my experience in operations leadership, food-service management, and process-driven workplace improvement, along with my transition into tech-enabled systems and digital workflow development.

## About Me

I come from high-volume, high-pressure restaurant environments where consistent quality and fast execution are not optional. Over 15+ years, I’ve led teams, trained new staff, optimized workflows, reduced waste, and built systems that turn daily chaos into reliable output.

I believe in:
- Leading from the front
- Staying calm under pressure
- Making systems that support people
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Using technology to increase consistency, speed, and clarity

I am actively growing in software tools, automation, and modern operations technology to bridge real-world leadership experience with digital infrastructure and service systems.

## What This Project Is

A simple, elegant personal site built using clean, responsive HTML and CSS.  
It includes:

- A themed résumé layout (forest green / burnt orange brand toggle)
- Print-ready / PDF-ready export
- Accessible, readable, and mobile-friendly structure
- No frameworks, no bloat — fast and intentional

This site represents both my background and the discipline I am applying to my learning in tech and digital systems.

## Why I Built It

To showcase:
- Practical leadership experience
- Attention to detail and presentation
- Ability to ship and iterate
- Willingness to learn new tools and adapt to modern workflows

This is part of a broader transition journey — building portfolio pieces, documenting progress, and demonstrating the crossover between frontline leadership and emerging tech skills.

## Deployment

You can view the site locally by opening `index.html` in any browser, or by enabling GitHub Pages and setting the branch to `main` under repository settings.
